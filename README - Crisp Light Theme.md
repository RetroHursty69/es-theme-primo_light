# Primo LIGHT Theme - April 2018

# Credits:
Special thanks to the creator of the Chicuelo Theme that this theme is based on. That was some amazing work and I hope my version of it does not detract from how good it is.

FOR A BETTER USER EXPERIENCE SET THE UI TRANSITION STYLE TO INSTANT
SET ON-SCREEN HELP TO OFF
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As usual I make this for you guys, the community.
I don't even play games much these days. So if you want something added, just let me know and I will see what i can do.
